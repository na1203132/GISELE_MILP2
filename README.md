MILP optimization for grid topology planning in rural areas of developing contries



Project is composed by 3 python codes:

Model I: is the pyomo optimization model, that takes the files generated by the input code and performs the optimization

Input_data_preparation: takes as input a csv file with the nodes coordinates and their associated power and produces
  the csv files required by the optimization model
  
Output_data_processing: must be run in order to post process the output file (connections_outpus.csv) and give the file final.csv, that
  can be visualized in QGIS
  
 
Data visualization:
In QGIS it is possible to load the input file ('Namanjavira.csv') which contains the coordinates of the secondary substations and
the output file ('final.csv'). In order to see the actual connections the output file must be loaded 2 times, considering once the coordinates
X1 and Y1 and secondly X2 and Y2. With the QGIS command ('join by lines') it is possible to draw the connections-
